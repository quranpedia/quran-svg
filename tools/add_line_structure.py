"""Add per-line structure to the mushaf page SVGs, and write `lines/NNN.json` beside them.

A page's whole body is one `<path>` — `hafs/255`'s `d` is 456,221 characters — with no
markup to say where one line ends and the next begins. This groups that path's glyph
contours into `<g class="line" data-line="N">`, N counting from 1 at the top of the
rendered page, and writes the same geometry out as JSON for consumers that would rather
not parse SVG.

The restructuring is a pure regrouping. Every contour is copied out of the source
byte-for-byte; the only numbers this program writes into an SVG are the absolute `moveto`
that has to replace a relative one when a contour is lifted out of its original chain, and
those round-trip through float64 exactly. The filled region is therefore identical, which
`check` proves per page and `verify_render.py` confirms by rendering.

Usage:

    tools/add_line_structure.py                       # every mushaf
    tools/add_line_structure.py --mushaf hafs/kfqc    # one edition
    tools/add_line_structure.py --check               # validate only, write nothing
    tools/add_line_structure.py --no-brotli           # skip regenerating svg-br/
    tools/verify_render.py hafs/kfqc                  # render every page before and after

Re-running is safe: a page that already carries line groups is restored to its original
shape first, so the tool is idempotent and can be re-run whenever the pages are
regenerated upstream.
