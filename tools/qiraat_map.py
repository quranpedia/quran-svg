"""Which counting system does a mushaf follow, and how many ayat does each surah have in it?

The ten qiraat do not agree on where every ayah ends, so a mushaf's ayah identities can only
be checked against the counting madhhab (``نظام العد``) its qiraa actually follows.  The
mapping and the disputed boundaries come from the vendored
`quranpedia/qiraat-ayah-map <https://github.com/quranpedia/qiraat-ayah-map>`_ dataset in
``tools/data/qiraat-ayah-map`` — see ``SOURCE.md`` there.

The dataset states its boundaries relative to the Kufan reference: for a surah it lists the
kufi ayah ends that some systems do *not* count (``end``) and the extra ends inside a kufi
ayah that some systems *do* count (``internal``).  A system's count for a surah is therefore

    kufi_count + (internal points that system counts) - (kufi ends that system omits)

Undisputed kufi ends are implicit and omitted from the dataset, which is why the Kufan counts
have to be supplied; ``kufi_counts_from_surah_json`` reads them from a mushaf that follows the
Kufan system and checks the total is 6236 before trusting them.
